Smart Lock System Using Arduino and NodeMCU with BLYNK
In this project, we have made the Smart Lock System Using Arduino , Keypad & NodeMCU. As thefts are increasing day by day security is becoming a major concern nowadays. So a digital code lock can secure your home or locker easily. It will open your door only when the right password is entered.

The circuit of this project is very simple which contains Arduino, keypad module, buzzer, Solenoid lock, and LCD. Arduino controls the complete processes like taking a password from the keypad module, comparing passwords, driving buzzer, actuating solenoid lock, and sending status to the LCD display. The keypad is used for taking the password. The buzzer is used for indications. Solenoid lock is used for opening the gate  and LCD is used for displaying status or messages on it. If the code is wrong then it sends an alert message to the owner.NodeMCU is used for communication from lock tto BLYNK Application.


Note- Use the old BLYNK application and not the BLYNK IOT application
